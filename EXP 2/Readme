EXPERIMENT 2
Identify the system calls to copy the content of one file to another and illustrate the same using a C program
AIM: Identify the system calls to copy the content of one file to another and illustrate the same using a C program
ALGORITHM:
•	Include necessary headers:
•	Include the necessary header files like <stdio.h>, <fcntl.h>, and
<unistd.h> for working with file-related system calls.
•	Declare variables:
•	Declare variables to hold file descriptors, buffer, and other necessary information.
•	Open the source and destination files:
•	Use the open system call to open the source and destination files, obtaining file descriptors for each.
•	Read from the source file:
•	Use the read system call to read data from the source file into a buffer.
•	Write to the destination file:
•	Use the write system call to write the data read from the source file into the destination file.
•	Close the files:
Use the close system call to close the source and destination files.
